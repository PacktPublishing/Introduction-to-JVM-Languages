This is the code repository for [Introduction to JVM Languages](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/introduction-jvm-languages?utm_source=GitHub), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the book from start to finish.
## About the Book
The book will begin with a general introduction of the JVM and its features, which are common to the JVM languages, helping you get abreast with its concepts. It will then dive into explaining languages such asJava, Scala, Clojure, Kotlin, and Groovy and will show how to work with each language, their features, use cases, and pros and cons. By writing example projects in those languages and focusing on each languageâ€™s strong points, it will help you find the programming language that is most appropriate for your particular needs.
## Instructions and Navigation
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
  Product p = new Product();

  p.setName("Box of biscuits");
```
